This mod adds more natural behavior to natural disasters.


Thundestorm

- Occurs only when raining. (In the base game it occurs at random time and forces rain to start.)
- High probability in summer, low in winter.
- Long summer rain will almost definetely be accompanied with a thunderstorm.
- Equal probability for all intencities. (As in the base game.)


Forest fire

- Do not occur when raining and for a while after rain. (Except firing by lightning or meteor strike.)
- Higher probability at high air temperatures.
- Higher probability if ther was no rain for a long period of time.
- Usually occurs 1-2 times per year.
- Equal probability for all intencities. (As in the base game.)


Earthquake

- Small earthquakes occur more often, large earthquakes occur rare.
- Large earthquakes are followed by several afershocks of smaller magnitudes.
- Expect one or two earthquakes per year.


Tsunami

- Small tsunamies occur more often, large tsunamies occur rare.
- Expect about one tsunami per two years.
- Huge tsunamies will probably come every 10-20 years (quite rare).


Tornado

- Small tornadoes occur more often, large tornadoes occur rare.
- Tornadoes might come in groups. However a huge tornado will not come more than one at a time (It might be accompanied with one or several smaller tornadoes though.)
- Will not come at foggy weather.
- Expect about one tornado event per two years.


Meteor Strike

- Small meteors fall time to time (once per year or two).
- Large meteors are rare but usually are accompanied with several smaller ones.

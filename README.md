## Disasters info panel

Shows current probabilities and maximum intesity values for all disasters. Some detailed info can be seen in toolips by mouseover.

Also contains the Emergency Button (see below).

Show / hide the disasters info panel by clicking the "Lightning" button at the top-left of the screen, or use the key shortcut Shift+D.


## Emergency Button

One of the most annoying thing about disasters is that they soullessly destroy the world you wholeheartedly created. To save your most valuable creation from destruction, just press the Emergency Button at the bottom of the disasters info panel * this stops all currently occuring disasters, including falling meteors and approaching tsunami waves.

In the current version, there are no restrictions how many times you can press the Emergency Button.


## Logging

The mod logs out information about all occured disasters into csv file in the CS data directory (C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines).
* date
* name
* intensity
* reason (mod or vanilla)

Can be turned on/off in the mod options.


## Minor features
* Maximum intensity for all disasters is set to the minimum (10) at the beginning of the game and gradually increases up to the maximum (100) until the city population reaches 20000.
* Duration of small intensity thunderstorms is decreased.
* Meteoroid stream period and phase (next approaching time) are randomized at the beginning of the game.
